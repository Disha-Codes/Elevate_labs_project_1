This project analyses retail transaction and product-level data to uncover insights related to sales performance, profitability, 
and inventory movement. Using MySQL for data preparation and KPI computation, Python (Pandas) for correlation analysis, and Tableau 
for visualization, the study identifies key profit drivers, slow-moving products, and seasonal demand patterns. The analysis 
supports data-driven decision-making for pricing, inventory planning, and category-level optimization.

Tools Used
•	MySQL Workbench – Data cleaning, joins, KPI calculations, and creation of SQL view.
•	Python (Pandas) – Profitability calculation and correlation analysis.
•	Tableau – Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization.

Strategic Insights & Recommendations
•	Sub-categories with high sales but relatively low profit indicate pricing or cost inefficiencies.
•	Slow-moving products with low sales and low profit margins represent overstocking risk.
•	Weak correlation between inventory movement and profitability suggests the need to focus on pricing strategy, supplier 
cost optimization, and category rationalization.

Recommendations:
•	Optimize pricing and discount strategies for low-margin products
•	Reduce procurement quantities for consistently slow-moving items
•	Bundle slow-moving products with fast-selling items
•	Align inventory planning with seasonal demand patterns
•	Review supplier contracts for profit-draining sub-categories

Final Conclusion
The Tableau dashboard provided an interactive view of retail performance across regions, product categories, and seasons. 
By combining SQL-based profitability analysis and Python correlation insights, the project delivered actionable strategies 
to improve inventory turnover and overall business profitability.
